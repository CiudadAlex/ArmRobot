Arm Robot setup:

1. Unplug the USB Camera from the Rhaspberry Pi (this allows that the boot process does not
   find the camera and will not start using it, preventing the program to access it)
2. Connect to the electric power
3. Connect to the network LAN cable
4. Switch on the robot and wait for the beep that indicates the boot process is over
5. Plug the USB Camera to the Rhaspberry Pi so that it configures to the device
   /dev/video0
   and gets ready for the program to use
